title: Python 11 Features
---

Python 3.11 was published on October 24, 2022, whihc is faster and more user friendly than the previous version. As in every version, Python 3.11 also comes with lot of improvements and changes. 

You can view all the list of changes in this python [official documentation](
    https://docs.python.org/3.11/whatsnew/3.11.html).

Here, I will tell you about the some cool features in this release.

1. Better error messages with more informative tracebacks.
2. Faster code execution due to considerable effort in the Faster Cpython project.
3. Several new Typing features that improve python's static typing support.



# So, Should you upgrade to Python 3.11?

One common problems with the new realeases is that third-party packages that you are depend on might not be ready for the new release on the initial day.
