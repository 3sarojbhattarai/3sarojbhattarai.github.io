# Personal Blog !

This repository hosts the code for my personal [blog](https://3sarojbhattarai.github.io).

The website is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) — a static site generator written in Python — and uses a theme based on [minimal-mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes).
